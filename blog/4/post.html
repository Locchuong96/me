      <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
      <p>Carbon, or Carbon-Lang, is an experimental, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language">general-purpose programming language</a>. The project is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">open-source</a> and was started by Google, following in the footsteps of previous Google-made programming languages (Go and Dart). 
        Google engineer Chandler Carruth first introduced Carbon at the CppNorth conference in Toronto in July 2022.
        He stated that Carbon was created to be a C++ successor. The language is expected for a 1.0 release to occur in 2024 or 2025.
        They say:
        <br>
        - JavaScript → TypeScript
        <br>
        - Java → Kotlin
        <br>
        - C++ → Carbon
      </p>
        <p>As the development team annouced, Carbon will have these adavances:
        <h4>Fast and works with C++</h4>
        With LLVM (a set of compiler and toolchain technologies that can be used to develop a front end for any programming language and a back end for any instruction set architecture.)
        Carbon's performance will be match C++, and this language can access to bits and addresses (also know as the memory addresses).
        <br>
        Carbon can work with  your exisiting C++ code. from inheritance to templates. So we don't worry about build everything from scratch.
        So carbon is a compiled language.
        <h4>Modern and evolving</h4>
        The syntax quite similar to C++, and an easy,tool-based upgrades between each version of Carbon.
        <h4>Welcoming open-source community</h4>
        As Python, the development team define Carbon as a open language, and they wellcome the other contributors.This is really a bright point of view.
        You can see the successful of Python when they build an community.They said Batteries-included approach: compiler, libraries, docs, tools, package manager, and more...
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="header1">Why they build Carbon Programming language?</h2>
      <p>
        When we need an performance-critical software, The answer is C++. Today C++ is not an popular language as 20th century.
        But you know the ranking is not everything. There are the differences between usages of them. In this century ,the hardware systems become clearly and easy for software developer.
        In this century, we are building the applications, website, APIs services,etc, and we build them with packages, tools, libraries...That is the reason
        why people does not use C++ as 20th century.
        <br>
        But improving C++ is extremly difficult because alot of problems accumulated from time to time. The developement team have an description about it <a href="https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/blob/trunk/docs/project/difficulties_improving_cpp.md">here</a>
        They call these problems is technical debts :). So their solution is to void inheriting the legacy of C or C++ directy, and instead start with solid language foundations like modern generics system, modular code organization, and consistent, simple syntax.
        Alot of existing modern langugae already provide an excellent developer experience as Go,Swift,Rust and many more . But these languages present significant barries to adoption and migration from C++.
        And it seem like C++ legacy is so big to avoid.
        <br>
        Carbon is the solution. It is designed around interoperability with C++ as well as large-scale adoption and migration for existing C++ codebases and developers.
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="header2">Language goals</h2>
      <p>You can read the detail from the development team <a href="https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/blob/trunk/docs/project/goals.md">here</a>. The summary of their goals
        <br>- Performance-critical software
        <br>- Software and language evolution
        <br>- Code that is easy to read, understand, and write
        <br>- Practical safety and testing mechanisms
        <br>- Fast and scalable development
        <br>- Modern OS platforms, hardware architectures, and environments
        <br>- Interoperability with and migration from existing C++ code
        <br>
        And they clearly say that, a stable application interface (ABI) and perfect backwards or forwards compability is not in this goal.
        Meaning we still have alot of work in the future for next candidates.
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="header3">Quick start</h2>
      <p>Now we can try programming with Carbon on the <a href="https://godbolt.org/">compiler explorer</a>
        without any installation or setup.
        But you can also try to build from source code follow their instructions on GitHub.
